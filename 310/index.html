This module covers the basics of what a programmer needs to know about mobile UX.<br>The agenda covers the majority of UI & UX knowledge as related to programmers. <br>- The basics of UI/UX will cover the fundamental questions that you need to always keep in mind when developing<br> - Inputs will discuss the elements that you have available to help augment the users experience and simplify your design<br> - Navigation covers the principles of good flow through an app, and when to use proper windows and types<br> - How we provide feedback is critical to a user, showing none, or too much is very easy, this will help understand when to provide feedback to a user<br> - We’ll review good tools for design, while not a module focused on actually creating art, there are a number of tools that can help reduce the cost to design convey ideas to artists that might not have the knowledge of proper mobile design<br> - Lastly, we’ll cover some basics of rapid UI/UX testing to develop an app the right way.</div>

This is important for everyone that touches the project to be aware of so that it drives the right experience for the user. <br> - Focus on your primary consumer. Which one makes you the money? If there are more than 5 segments to your market, pick the top two. You will not be able to please everyone with your app. That is why there is more than 90,000 of them in the app store. This is why we see massive updates to how apps work. <br> - <b>Example: </b> A good example of this is the Facebook app. If you have Facebook apps or pages, you can’t use their app to control them. This is by design, as 600 million people want to read their news feed, and only a fraction of a percentile of those people will manage their pages. <br> - Remove your personal opinion. If you are working on the project you are probably to close to the product. Always revert back to the consumer and ask “Is it what they need”. <br> - <b>Recommendation: </b> Put a picture of your key consumer on your desk when working on the project to remind you who this is for.</div>

It can provide directional information related to how the device is being held and in what axis. This is awesome information to record or to have available at times that you want to switch experience.<br>With location based apps, the accelerometer and compass can be used in tandem to plot points and help dictate data standards to your surroundings. Accessing this information is very easy, and can provide a very simple way to augment the experience of your user.<br>Moving your device could trigger a quick page flip or augment the situation of a scrollbar. Think about how you scroll your data? If you didn’t have to flick to scroll and just tip you device a little, could that improve experience?<br>The accelerometer dictates your devices orientation or portrait or landscape.

Or both?<br>It’s a problem that you need to address upfront to ensure that the proper experience is adhered to.<br>HIG – iPad should account for all four orientations<br>iPhone should be either:<ul><li>locked to portrait</li><li>or, portrait, landscape left/right but not upside down so that folks don’t accidentally have their phone upside down when making/receiving a call</li></ul></div>

					<div class="slidenote"><p class="l_slidenote_modal_windows"></p>Modal windows stop action – login screens, alert type messages, etc.<br>Make them useful and part of the experience<br>They are an expected UX component<br>Modal windows are windows that require interaction before returning to their parent application. This is a fitting definition as that’s how they should be used. Modal windows show split actions that require an action to deliver results. The most common is login and registration.<br>Using the login and registration example, if that process was in-line or a major tab item it would be poor UX. These are actions that will happen either only once, or a handful of times so making them a prominent navigation or element on the screen can cost you precious screen real-estate. This is why actions can trigger this response or smaller UI elements.<br>Modal windows must return something always! This isn’t a requirement in programming, but a requirement from a UX perspective. By interrupting my experience for a reason, I should have a result from performing an action on a window. If I hit cancel on a window, it should explain the benefit of logging in or registering after it closes. If I login in or register, I should get a success response and be taken to where I was going.<br>Programming wise, these windows are easy to create and close, however to the user that is interrupted by them, it can impose an inconvenience. This is why they need to have an easy way out. Close buttons and cancel buttons are critical elements that are not by default put on the windows.<br>People expect inconvenience with their apps and programs. It’s what has been programmed into us for a long time. Providing these barriers to information is expected at certain areas. Just ensure you do proper testing and gather your feedback to determine where those areas are before imposing them everywhere. I should be able to do almost everything a user should be able to do so that my experience is enriched. It will lead to a happier user.</div>

The more that you chart the experience and ensure you are pleasing that key user, the easier it will be to grow adoption.<br>The benefit is in the details of your application, and that brings us to the last major section that discusses tools that are native to your devices.<br>Indicators and status are often overlooked as additional items to add after the fact. And more often when they are added, they don’t provide the necessary feedback that a user needs to understand what is going on. A large part of this data relies on the lead developer to be aware of. Designers are in the world of star trek when it comes to technology. What I mean by that is that only the reactor fails, the computers never fail ?<br>When we do have data fail, we need to indicate it to the user, otherwise they will leave our app in frustration.</div>

					<div class="slidenote"><p class="l_slidenote_loading_ind"></p>Feedback is crucial, especially during long duration tasks like uploading <br>Did it work? Is it done?<br>Loading indicators provide numerous levels of feedback to a user. When you are sending an email from a phone there is a visual feedback that sending is occurring and an audio indicator once it’s complete. This is important to the user as it acknowledges that their action is complete. When it doesn’t work, it informs us directly that there was an error and more importantly asks us for an action related to it… “Should I try again?”<br>Without those actions, we would assume that it either works 100% of the time or fails 100% of the time. Feedback to the user is crucial at this impasse.<br>Providing information to a user based on an action, such as “Uploading 20%” or “Submitting” or even suggesting an alternate action like “While I’m uploading why not…” are items that can provide added benefit to a user and keep retention of a user. Showing a simple message of “Loading…” is not enough most of the time and has become common practice. If your app performs multiple actions to deliver results, why not stage your indicator to say so?<br>Show the progress of your loading if you can! Having a progress bar is a key area to manage expectations of a user. Infinity Blade is one of the most popular games on the iPhone, but when loading can appear frozen sometimes. This is because there is nothing to indicate the total load sequence or time involved in loading the game. By adding even a simple one, they could manage the expectations of their game players by showing when they can expect to play the game.<br>Lastly, developers need to mange pass/fail times. How long have some of us waited for an action to be completed and it just hangs? Manage the experience of the user by having a timeout. If it takes more than 30 seconds to deliver results, either they have a horrible connection, or your data is being a pain. Foursquare is good at this area. If I cannot connect right away it tells me. I’m disappointed, but its managed. I don’t continue to wait and build frustration.</div>

Now I say this with the best intentions as I don’t mean they are dogs. Instead, you need to <b>reward good behavior</b> with positive reinforcement and <b>punish</b> errors with corrective reinforcement.<br>When a user does something positive, you can trigger an alert to show them that their action was received or rewarded. However, alerts are only ok, as it requires dismissal and branding them isn’t as cost effective as other methods.<br>Now triggering action screens are a great way as you now utilize the entire device screen, but you also remove them from the core action they were just at. This is great for rewards or following through on additional call to actions.<br>However, active results are the best. Weather inline or in the global namespace, they are results that inform the user of feedback regardless of what their actions in the application are. One of the most common actions related to this is game center notifications. Doesn’t matter where you are in the application, it still informs you of your achievement.<br>Feedback is a very positive reinforcement of action. Use it to your advantage in your application and think of it as a key element, not a secondary thought.<br>With that being said….</div>

					<div class="slidenote"><p class="l_slidenote_dont_over"></p>While it’s important to tell the user what they are doing, it’s also important to ensure they don’t receive too much feedback.<br>Keep these items in mind when informing a user what’s going on with their interaction with the application.<br> - <b>Only provide the feedback when necessary.</b> If you provide information on a consistent basis for repetitive actions that produce expected results, then they don’t need an alert to tell them it was successful. This is also helpful for information that is local storage driven. Local storage is exceptionally quick, so why should we provide constant feedback. Actions speak louder than words here, so when you remove an items from a tableview, that visual feedback of removal is enough.<br> - <b>Don’t remind the user constantly.</b> Constant “nagging” of a user will drive them away. Think of it like asking a girl out, the more you ask the more she’ll ignore you right ? ? Only ask the user a few times for information based on their intents in the application. Remind them politely and ensure you have a action to react on.<br> - <b>Avoid loops and situations that cause extensive dialogs. </b>I shouldn’t have to be informed more than once to do something, especially if I’m wrong.</div>

You have to go back to the core three questions:<br>What problem(s) am I solving?<br>Who are my key users?<br>What are their needs?<br>This will answer if you are serving their needs properly.<br>Then ask if the data really fits. It might, but not in the proper area that you are currently showing. Determine if it’s decision based information, does that image really need to be there, what about that text. If you cannot justify why the data is there, then it probably doesn't’t belong there.<br>Lastly, pull your ego and talents of what you can do out of the project. I was once asked if Titanium could display 10,000 rows of data because “core data can do this.” First, yes it can, but more importantly, if you are displaying 10,000 rows of data, you have a horrible UX challenge to solve in front of you. Features are features, and designing for the best UX is what dictates proper development.</div>

					<div class="slidenote"><p class="l_slidenote_dev_test"></p>Development and Testing<br>One of the biggest benefits of Titanium is it’s ability to rapidly develop apps. If you have a good mockup for UX that is receiving stellar feedback from your test group, then start building it in Titanium and get it out there to other users. Refined design will simply enhance the core experience, but it shouldn’t limit what you can gain from doing a good “skeleton style” app.</div>

					<div class="slidenote"><p class="l_slidenote_ti_test"></p>You can use mock screens / static graphics to further test your UI<br>Can test positioning, etc.<br>Use placeholder images and text<br>Now that you have mockups, bring your programming skills to the table and start creating the technical side of the application. If you connect to webservices, fake them, if you are loading data, set a timeout on your preloader (you can refactor it later for added benefit).<br>The goal of this exercise is to get your main structure in place and in the hands of some test users. This is your real app now, the responses should be nearly the same as your UX test prior. This is just the next step.<br>Get your core elements in the app. Custom fonts, colors, and positioning of these elements are all items that should be set. These items can then be wrapped with images and other elements to enhance the UI, but the initial UX should have these elements in place as much as possible.<br>For places that use images, create dummy images of that size for placeholders. This doesn’t need to be everywhere, but in enough places to show spacing or artwork.<br>Lastly, unless you have data do NOT use real copy, use Lorem Ipsum. This is Greek copy that will not distract the user with spelling or content, but will provide you with feedback on the design of the element instead.</div>

At some point you have to do something. This is where you divide and conquer the best you can. Always continue your testing, this is where A|B can really help along with user feedback on your initial app.<br>You will never be complete, no one ever is, in fact I already want to redo this presentation, but without locking something down, it becomes vaporware. Decide to act and get your responses.<br>Remember in your first, second, third, or any release what your minimum viable product is. This can be different from release to release, but always keep that in mind.<br>UI/UX is exceptionally important. If you look at the top paid apps, and featured apps, almost all of them know exactly what they are doing for their user. If nothing else, make sure what you r working on has true value to your user, and that you are satisfying their needs.</div>

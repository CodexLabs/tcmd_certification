There are several ways to go about getting one, and developing one, but the fact is that you should at the least have a cheat sheet describing your strategy, consumer needs, and a list of your primary and secondary colors, fonts and icons if developed.<br> - These should revolve around understanding your consumer, not yourselves! If you understand your consumers trends, then it will help dictate the design elements<br> - Develop a single page brand that everyone can adopt. This will help tremendously so that there is no lack of consistency in design and implementation.<br>Lastly understand the emotion of your company, the culture behind it, locate the style of how you represent the brand and where your targets are.

The app icon and default screens are the easiest ones to attack. Once you understand the brand, focus the UI on the core message to the consumer. Your app icon is the very first piece of art that people will judge your app on. Design it wisely and make sure that it flows with your app appropriately.<br>As mentioned in the last module, make sure that your brand colors flow in the appropriate areas through your application. If you determine all headers are to be white, make sure that you are consistent. This is deciding brand rules for your application design. Designers often don't think of apps as interactive pieces all the time so if you see variances in the artwork make sure to ask 'why'. It is very important for the designer to describe every pixel on the screen.<br>UI components are also very easy to modify if you have the assets available.

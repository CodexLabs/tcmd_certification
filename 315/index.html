				SLIDE INSTRUCTIONS:
					- Set the <title> tag to this lesson's US English title
					- Set the <meta description tag to the US English course & lesson title
					- Add one <section></section> for each slide. Slides can contain most any valid HTML
					- Each text tag (<p> or <li> or <h1> etc.) must have a class name that begins with
						"l_" and is unique. Each of those class names must be added to the i18n/localizations.js
						file and their values must be set equal to the US English version of the strings. That 
						file is used for translation and its contents OVERRIDES the text in this file.
					- Each slide must have a <div class="slidenote"></div> container, which can be empty. These
						are used for presenter notes. They also must be given unique "l_" classnames and strings
						provided in the localizations.js file.
					- Please use inline CSS on the slides to size & arrange contents.
					- Graphics should be placed in the images folder and cropped/sized appropriately.
					- Assume a 1024 x 768 display resolution
					- A link to the index.html for each lesson must be added in order to the coursename/index.html
						title slide.

This is a trend that is constantly going to evolve, but provides a conundrum to Titanium users that don’t have custom module experience. How to I replicate that experience?<br>While this largely focuses on how to develop a custom tab bar, largely this is about brand and using components that are not normally used for improved design.<br>We’ll discuss custom navigation and how to get the most out of your components. Since most of you know how to style and improve upon the existing components, I would encourage you to think how those can be used in different ways to vary the user interface to help drive the experience of your consumer.</div>

There are several ways to go about getting one, and developing one, but the fact is that you should at the least have a cheat sheet describing your strategy, consumer needs, and a list of your primary and secondary colors, fonts and icons if developed.<br> - These should revolve around understanding your consumer, not yourselves! If you understand your consumers trends, then it will help dictate the design elements<br> - Develop a single page brand that everyone can adopt. This will help tremendously so that there is no lack of consistency in design and implementation.<br>Lastly understand the emotion of your company, the culture behind it, locate the style of how you represent the brand and where your targets are. This will help develop artistic style and guide in the principles of what the app should convey to the user.</div>

The app icon and default screens are the easiest ones to attack. Once you understand the brand, focus the UI on the core message to the consumer. Your app icon is the very first piece of art that people will judge your app on. Design it wisely and make sure that it flows with your app appropriately.<br>As mentioned in the last module, make sure that your brand colors flow in the appropriate areas through your application. If you determine all headers are to be white, make sure that you are consistent. This is deciding brand rules for your application design. Designers often don’t think of apps as interactive pieces all the time so if you see variances in the artwork make sure to ask “why”. It is very important for the designer to describe every pixel on the screen.<br>UI components are also very easy to modify if you have the assets available. Make you that you use consistent colors and designs throughout your application that accurately represent what they are.</div>

Same goes for the default title control. Sure you can change color, but believe it or now, most don’t spend the time to do so.<br>This leads us to what is not by default branded in your application and this is the tab bar and title control. By owing these two items that are consistent across most of your app, you can drastically change the appeal, emotion, and style of your final application.<br>We’ll focus specifically on the title and tab bar.</div>
